# Progress — Nuevo Amanecer (Industrial Maintenance)

Bilingual (EN/ES) marketing site for **Desarrolladora Nuevo Amanecer del Sureste
S.A. de C.V.** — industrial duct / HVAC ventilation cleaning + preventive technical
maintenance for hotels, hospitals, universities, malls and restaurants in Cancún &
Mérida. Next.js 16 + next-intl + Tailwind v4, deployed on Vercel.

> Built on the `chimney-service` repo (originally a placeholder "Riviera Hearth"
> hotel-chimney template). Reframe source of truth: `docs/reference-existing-site.md`
> (pulled from the client's live site nuevoamanecer.company).

## Status

- [x] Project scaffold (Next.js 16, Tailwind v4, Vitest, Playwright)
- [x] EN/ES i18n (locale routing, language switcher, parity-tested catalogs)
- [x] Design system + UI primitives (industrial steel-blue / cyan palette)
- [x] Pages: Home, Services, Gallery, Documented work, About, Contact
- [x] Gallery carousel + contact form (Web3Forms + mailto fallback) — TDD
- [x] SEO (per-locale metadata, hreflang, OG image, sitemap, robots)
- [x] **Reframed to real client Nuevo Amanecer** — brand, real bilingual copy
      (4 services, process, about, SEO) from their live site
- [x] **New sections:** Sectores atendidos (5) + Equipamiento (6)
- [x] **Real client photos** wired into gallery / documented-work / about; hero uses
      matching industrial stock; placeholder testimonials removed (no real ones yet)
- [x] **Real contacts:** business line (dnasolution66@gmail.com / +52 998 154 0967)
      + Director (Lázaro Rondón) + Comercial (Marcos Machado)
- [x] CI gate (lint → typecheck → test → build) green; 39 tests passing
- [x] AI imagery — no-face thematic SDXL originals generated + wired: twilight rooftop
      AHUs as the **hero**, gleaming spiral ductwork as the **CTA-band** background
      (kitchen hood / blower / golden-hour rooftop / clean-duct kept as spares).
      Recorded in `CREDITS.md`. Gallery/before-after deliberately stay real photos only.
  - The client's exact "real crew in AI scenes" ask is **not possible locally** — SDXL
    is text-to-image only (no faithful face-swap/LoRA pipeline); real crew photos cover it
- [x] Committed (`147a6b6`) + pushed to `main`; Vercel auto-deployed — **build green**
- [x] **Live & public** at **https://chimney-service-cancun.vercel.app/en** (HTTP 200,
      Deployment Protection off — verified). NB: the bare `chimney-service.vercel.app`
      is a **different, unrelated** project ("#1 Kitchen Chimney Service"), not ours.
- [x] Canonical/OG/sitemap URL fixed in code — `data/site.ts` `url` now points to
      `chimney-service-cancun.vercel.app` (was the wrong bare domain). Takes effect on
      next deploy. Optionally also set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in Vercel (overrides it).
- [~] **Web3Forms** key created (`chimneycontactform`); added to local `.env.local`.
      Still needed: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_KEY` in Vercel env + redeploy (NEXT_PUBLIC
      vars are build-time, so the live build won't have it until a fresh deploy). Set the
      recipient inbox in the Web3Forms dashboard (Linked Emails / form Settings).
- [x] **Deployed:** stats paint-order fix + new AI hero/CTA imagery + URL fix pushed
      (`2889c9c` on `origin/main`) and live (HTTP 200, verified 2026-06-23).
- [x] **Navbar readability:** desktop links grouped into a frosted pill (matches the
      language-switcher pill), higher-contrast text + accent hover, solid accent chip for
      the active page; mobile menu links moved off the washed-out muted gray.
- [x] **SEO URL hardening:** the live site was emitting doubled `/en/en` canonicals +
      sitemap URLs and a wrong `/en/sitemap.xml` robots pointer, because the Vercel
      `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` env var carried a stray `/en` (copied from the address bar).
      Centralised the URL into `lib/site-url.ts` (`siteOrigin`), normalised to a bare
      origin so any stray path is stripped; layout/sitemap/robots all consume it.
      Verified: a build with the bad env value now emits correct single-locale URLs.
      Optional cleanup: also delete/fix the Vercel env var (code default is already correct).
- [ ] Pending real details from the client: exact street addresses, office hours,
      consented testimonials, social links, logo/brand mark
- [ ] Optional: attach paid custom domain

## Resuming on another machine

Everything below is in git — clone and you're caught up. Requires Node 22+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vodkadav/chimney-service.git
cd chimney-service
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local      # optional; fill in for the live contact form
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000 (redirects to /en)
```

Verify the gate any time: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build`.

## Deploy state & manual steps

**Live & public:** https://chimney-service-cancun.vercel.app/en (HTTP 200, verified
2026-06-22). Auto-deploys on push to `main`. ⚠️ The bare `chimney-service.vercel.app`
is a **different, unrelated** project — never use it; ours is the `-cancun` host.

### Next session — start here (resume guide)

Everything code-side is done and deployed. Remaining work is all in the **Vercel /
Web3Forms dashboards** (no code needed):

1. **Web3Forms — finish the live contact form.** A key already exists (form
   `chimneycontactform`, key `b0b81ae9-b462-4e36-8f83-0c4c78e7e230` — public by design,
   safe to commit). It's in local `.env.local` already. To go live:
   - Vercel → Project → **Settings → Environment Variables** → add
     `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_KEY = b0b81ae9-b462-4e36-8f83-0c4c78e7e230` (Production), then
     **redeploy** (NEXT_PUBLIC vars are build-time — a redeploy is required to bake it in).
   - In the **Web3Forms dashboard** set the **recipient inbox** (Linked Emails / form
     Settings) to the address that should receive leads (e.g. `dnasolution66@gmail.com`).
   - Free plan = **one** recipient. A 2nd inbox needs the Pro plan (`ccemail`, `;`-sep) —
     or just add a Gmail auto-forward. Until the key is live, the form falls back to
     `mailto:`, so the site still works.
2. *(Optional)* `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — not required anymore (code fallback is now the
   correct `-cancun` URL). Only set it if/when a **custom domain** is attached.
3. *(Optional, later)* attach a paid custom domain in Vercel → **Settings → Domains**,
   then set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to it and redeploy.
4. **Pending real content from the client** (no blocker to being live): exact street
   addresses, office hours, consented testimonials, social links, logo/brand mark —
   collect via `docs/Formulario-de-Contenido.docx`; structure in `docs/reference-existing-site.md`.

Verify live any time: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://chimney-service-cancun.vercel.app/en` (expect 200).

## Notes

- Created 2026-06-21; reframed to Nuevo Amanecer the same day.
- Real client job photos live in `public/photos/` (gallery/before-after/about);
  the hero + CTA band use locally-generated no-face AI imagery (`gen-*.png`, see
  `CREDITS.md`). Content is wired from `data/*.ts` + `messages/{en,es}.json`.
- The Spanish client intake form (`docs/Formulario-de-Contenido.docx`) can still be
  used to collect the remaining real details (addresses, hours, testimonials, logo).
